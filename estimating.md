# Estimating

Consistently estimating the time it will take to implement even small and well understood software components is impossible with any degree of accuracy. Software engineering is a creative endeavor, with very few constraints on possible solutions. Even then, valid solutions are very often not valid for long as the problem itself often changes and morphs over time.

Yet, estimating is very important in order to plan work, manage resources and set expectations. The paradox of estimating being important, yet impossible, may someday be solved, but is still, at best, a work in progress and requires compromises to be effective.

There are two primary compromises that software engineers are allowed to make estimating effective enough to be useful. The first compromise is the understanding that the accuracy of estimations are directly related to
