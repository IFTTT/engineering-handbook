# Estimating

## Estimating is hard

Consistently estimating the time it will take to implement even small and well understood software components is impossible with any degree of accuracy. Software engineering is a creative endeavor, with very few constraints on possible solutions. Even then, valid solutions are very often not valid for long as the problem itself often changes and morphs over time.

Yet, estimating is very important in order to plan work, manage resources and set expectations. The paradox of estimating being important, yet impossible, may someday be solved, but is still, at best, a work in progress and requires compromises to be effective.

There are always important considerations for engineers to make effective use of estimating:

#### The haze of time

We're all familiar with the phenomenon of haze, where objects that are far away appear hazy and are sometimes completely obscured relative to nearby objects. The same effect applies to estimating in that it is more difficult to estimate outcomes the further away they are in the future.

A task that you are going to do within the next couple of weeks is likely something you've already thought through to some extent or at least have some understanding of the context. A task that won't or can't be done for a longer than a few weeks or months is likely much less well understood. The world, especially when it involves software, changes rapidly and 

#### The moving target

That software is almost infinitely malleable is both a blessing and a curse. Even the most well conceived solutions can often be judged as completely missing the mark after or sometimes during implementation. At best, all solutions tend to evolve rapidly over time as feedback is incorporated from stakeholders.

Given that software solutions are the result of many small iterations, 

## FAQ

### Should I consider the time it takes to get approvals when estimating a story?

Nope, just estimate the time you'll be working on it. If you're waiting on something for more than a day, you can move the story to blocked, but the estimate should be the time it will take you to implement the story assuming you don't have to wait long for dependencies.
